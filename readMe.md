git is like a cafe. The working directory is like the kitchen. The cooks put together the code with different coding/cooking techniques. The different ingredients are the pieces of code. The staging area is the area where the waiters pick up the orders and check the food against the order forms. They decide whether or not the code/food is able to meet requirements; then either make the cooks fix it or decide it passes and take it out to the customer. The repository is the table that the customer is sitting at. The food/code is then severed up.
